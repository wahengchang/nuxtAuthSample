# 2. Dynamic Collections Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Dynamic Collections module in the smallCms project, covering both frontend and backend aspects.

## Routes and API Endpoints

### Frontend Routes
1. `/collections` - List all collections
2. `/collections/new` - Create new collection
3. `/collections/:id` - View/Edit collection
4. `/collections/:id/items` - List items in a collection
5. `/collections/:id/items/new` - Create new item in a collection
6. `/collections/:id/items/:itemId` - View/Edit item in a collection

### API Routes
1. GET `/api/collections` - List all collections
2. POST `/api/collections` - Create new collection
3. GET `/api/collections/:id` - Get collection details
4. PUT `/api/collections/:id` - Update collection
5. DELETE `/api/collections/:id` - Delete collection
6. GET `/api/collections/:id/items` - List items in a collection
7. POST `/api/collections/:id/items` - Create new item in a collection
8. GET `/api/collections/:id/items/:itemId` - Get item details
9. PUT `/api/collections/:id/items/:itemId` - Update item
10. DELETE `/api/collections/:id/items/:itemId` - Delete item

## Data Structures and Database Schema

### Collection Schema (MongoDB)
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  description: String,
  fields: [
    {
      name: String,
      type: String (enum: ['text', 'number', 'date', 'relation']),
      required: Boolean,
      options: Object // Additional options based on field type
    }
  ],
  isPublic: Boolean,
  createdBy: ObjectId (ref: 'User'),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Collection Item Schema (MongoDB)
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  collectionId: ObjectId (ref: 'Collection'),
  data: Object, // Dynamic structure based on collection fields
  createdBy: ObjectId (ref: 'User'),
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Critical Programming Logic

### Backend (Node.js with Express)

1. Collection Creation:
   - Validate input (name, description, fields)
   - Create new collection document
   - Generate dynamic MongoDB model based on collection fields

2. Dynamic Model Generation:
   - Create a function to generate Mongoose models dynamically based on collection fields
   - Handle different field types (text, number, date, relation)
   - Implement validation based on field requirements

3. Collection Item CRUD:
   - Use dynamic models for CRUD operations
   - Validate input against collection field definitions
   - Handle relations between collections

4. Access Control:
   - Implement middleware to check user permissions for each collection/item operation
   - Handle public/private collection access

5. Query Building:
   - Implement flexible query building for collection items
   - Support filtering, sorting, and pagination

### Frontend (Vue.js with Nuxt.js)

1. Collection Management:
   - Implement form for creating/editing collections
   - Dynamic form builder for defining collection fields
   - Display list of collections with CRUD options

2. Collection Item Management:
   - Dynamic form generation based on collection fields
   - Implement CRUD operations for collection items
   - Handle different field types in forms (text inputs, date pickers, number inputs, relation selectors)

3. Dynamic Routing:
   - Generate routes dynamically based on collections
   - Implement navigation between collections and items

4. State Management (Vuex):
   - Store collections and current collection items
   - Actions for CRUD operations on collections and items
   - Getters for filtering and sorting collection items

5. Relationship Handling:
   - Implement UI for selecting related items from other collections
   - Handle fetching and displaying related data

## Testing

### Backend API Tests (e.g., using Jest and Supertest)

1. Test collection CRUD operations:
   - Create collection with various field types
   - Retrieve collection details
   - Update collection fields
   - Delete collection

2. Test collection item CRUD operations:
   - Create items with different field values
   - Retrieve items with filtering and sorting
   - Update item fields
   - Delete items

3. Test access control:
   - Verify public/private collection access
   - Test user permissions for different operations

4. Test data validation:
   - Ensure data adheres to field type constraints
   - Test required field validation

### Frontend E2E Tests (e.g., using Cypress)

1. Test collection creation flow:
   - Navigate to create collection page
   - Fill out collection details and add fields
   - Submit form and verify new collection in list

2. Test collection item management:
   - Create new item in a collection
   - Edit existing item
   - Delete item
   - Verify changes reflected in item list

3. Test dynamic form generation:
   - Verify forms are correctly generated based on collection fields
   - Test different field types (text, number, date, relation)

4. Test navigation and routing:
   - Navigate between collections
   - Access collection items
   - Verify correct data loading for each route

5. Test access control on frontend:
   - Verify visibility of public vs. private collections
   - Test user interface changes based on user permissions

## Additional Considerations

1. Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed collections and items
2. Consider implementing real-time updates using WebSockets for collaborative editing
3. Optimize queries for large collections, possibly implementing server-side pagination
4. Implement robust error handling for API requests and display user-friendly error messages
5. Consider adding a search functionality across collections and items
6. Implement data export/import features for collections
7. Add field type validations on both frontend and backend
8. Consider implementing a draft/publish workflow for collection items
